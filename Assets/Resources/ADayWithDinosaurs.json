        We run to the sandstone ledge where <leader> is bending over a huge curved bone.  He's one of the world's top experts on dinosaurs.
        'It looks like a leg bone,' <player> says as <leader> brushes away some sand and pebbles.
        As we all step closer for a better view, <leader> looks around. 'I need a group of people to go back to the Jeep and get my pick' he says.  'I need to pry this rock out of the way.'
        We want to help, but we don't want to miss what happens next.",

      "page-text": "  We are in a big hurry our way back to the Jeep to get the pick.  <player> isn't watching where they are going and falls into a big hole.
        Looking around, we notice that the hole is actually the entrance to a cave.  We all peer inside.  We turn back toward the entrace only to find ourselves in a different world!  The ground ahead of us is flat and sandy.  Stubby plants are scattered here and there.  To one side is a mass of ferns.  A low hill rises between them.  In the distance are groves of trees with long spiked leaves.
        It doesn't take long for us to figure out what happened.  We've heard about a cave where each passageway leads to a different time.  This must be it!  The hole <last-player> fell into was an entrance to the Cave of Time.  We're sure we're not in our own time, because a huge dinosaur (twice as large as a rhinocerous) is walking straight towards us!  Along its huge, curving back are triangular plates that quiver as it walks.  At the tip of the tail are four giant spikes.
        We all run to one side.  The creature lumbers by.  No need to worry. <player> has seen pictures of this dinosaur.  It's a harmless stegosaurus, a plant eater.
        We watch the animal trod along the sandy earth.  It kicks up dust as it walks toward a water hole ringed with bristly plants.
        Ararrrk!  A loud moan comes from above.  We look up, expecting to see a bird.  Instead we see the head of a monster!  Our eyes travel down along its long, rubbery, neck.  What we had thought was a hill is the body of a giant creature, bigger than we thought even dinosaurs could be!  The great beast's tail is curled around so the tip is almost touching <player>'s foot!  Even a brontosaurus wasn't this big.  This must be the brachiosaurus, the most gigantic creature that ever walked the Earth.
        Garamph!
        Oh no!  Another beast is coming closer.  It lets out such a roar that <player> claps their hands to their ears.  Coming through the trees is a Tyrannosaurus rex (ten times as tall as we are!)  It's jaws could kill a lion with one bite!
        It sees us.",
